# Popcorncafe

**Popcorncafe** is a pet project of a fictional coffee network presented in the form of repositories related to the backend, frontend, and client application.

## Backend

The **Popcorncafe** backend consists of a group of microservices written in Java and utilizing the Spring Framework. These microservices use the following technologies:

- **Spring Boot**: for creating standalone microservices.
- **Spring Cloud**: for implementing shared infrastructure.
- **Spring Cloud Config**: for centralized configuration management.
- **Spring Cloud Netflix (Eureka)**: for service discovery and registration.
- **Spring Cloud Gateway**: for request management and routing.

Each microservice interacts with its own PostgreSQL database.
